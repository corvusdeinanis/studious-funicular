> [!NOTE]- Poem 
The winter evening settes down 
With smell of steaks in passagewats
Six o'clock 
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
And now a gusty shower wraps 
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers frm vacant lots;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps. 
And then the lighting of the lamps. 
The morning comes to consciousness 
of faint stale smells of beer 
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands,
With the other masquerades
That time resumes,
One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms.
You tossed a blanket from the bed,
You lay upon your back, and waited;
You dozed, and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
of which your soul was constituted;
They flickered against the ceiling,
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands;
Sitting along the bed's edge, where
You curled the papers from your hair,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands.
