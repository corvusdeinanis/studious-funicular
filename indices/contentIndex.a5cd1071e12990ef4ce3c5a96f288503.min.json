Some study methods work in many different situations and across topics, boosting test performance and long-term retention. Learning how to learn can have lifelong benefits.\n2.  Self-testing and spreading out study sessions ‚Äî so-called distributed practice ‚Äî are excellent ways to improve learning. They are efficient, easy to use and effective.\n3.
